# Hand-tracking pickup body — based on Marshall Nowak (Nocxr)'s PickupAbleBody3D from the
# visionosxr_hand_tracking reference project. Throw velocity on release is ours.
#
# ONE-HANDED GRAB. The grabbed POINT on the object stays pinned under your pinch and the object
# rotates ABOUT that point (grab-by-point), eased by a one-euro filter so raw hand-tracking jitter
# doesn't pass straight through (a raw 1:1 ride feels "electric"). Both the position anchor (pivot)
# AND the rotation come from the de-spiked THUMB-TIP joint (provided by the handler): a directly-
# tracked joint the INDEX can't disturb (pinch/pull/release move the index, not the thumb), and far
# stabler than the controller "aim" pose (which is pinch-derived and noisy). The handler holds the
# last good thumb value through a one-frame dropout, so brief self-occlusion doesn't snap the grab.

# Outline overlays (inverted-hull highlight shader): cyan when this is the closest grabbable, green
# while held, blue during two-hand scale. `grow` is LOCAL metres along the normal — keep small or the
# hull explodes. NOTE: the shader uniforms are `albedo` + `grow` (NOT outline_color/_width); the wrong
# names silently no-op (which is why every outline once rendered as the base yellow).
